Our letter today is from “Pretty Wurmple.” Yo, thanks for watching, Pretty Wurmple! Now whatta we got here... “I love stroking my Wurmple along its belly. You know, it’s just amazing! Depending on where and when you catch one, it totally changes how glossy it is and how it feels! Totally! Don’t you think that’s mysterious? But if I try to talk to my friends about any of this, they say I’m strange... Am I really just a weirdo?” Roman: My answer is... No way, José! It’s awesome to have something you really love. You know Roxanne, who’s the Gym Leader in Rustboro City? That girl loves Fossils so much she runs around Hoenn with a hammer in her hand, excavating everything in sight! She’s even been written up in specialist magazines a whole bunch of times! It’s cool to focus on the thing you love like that! Go for it, future Bug-type professor! I’ll be your number-one fan!

Tell me a cool-looking sport to do!” Roman: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You are some kinda shallow guy! But, hey, I never said I didn’t like it! So, uh, lemme see... Have you thought about surfing? Yo, tons of cool surfing spots around Dewford, here in Hoenn. They say that Gym Leader Brawly moved from Kanto ’cause you can surf all year! Brawly loves it, and he’s sure got one ripped body, so I think it’ll make you fit and buff, little dude! Whether girls will like you, though, that’s really up to you! See ya!\n...</NPC>

Our house is too small for me to get a room of my own. How can I make this more bearable?” Roman: Whoa. That’s a tough one, all right! How about you rearrange the furniture to make sort of a wall between the two of you? Gym Leader Wattson—man, is he amazing— traveled all over the world and learned all kinds of city-planning things, and he used ’em to make Mauville two stories tall! Counting the roof, he tripled the area of the city. And the population has QUADRUPLED! Maybe you can make smart use of your vertical space like he did! If that doesn’t work, plan on spending a lot of time in your Secret Base, I guess! See ya!\n...</NPC>

It’s totally unacceptable! Can you give me an effective beauty treatment to prevent further tragedies?” Roman: I feel the searing pain in this letter! Speaking of searing, maybe heat would help. Have you tried going to hot springs? That new Gym Leader Flannery goes in the hot springs every day, and she’s never had a single skin problem, according to interviews. But really, the most important things have gotta be a balanced diet and enough sleep. I’m backing you all the way, so hold on tight to your dreams! See ya!\n...</NPC>

If you could find a place like the one they went to, you could study both battling and Pokémon research! But it’s crazy to ask me about something big like this! Talk to your guidance counselor!

Please recommend a city where we can really experience nature to the max!” Roman: Ooooh! Thanks for thinking of Hoenn. We’d love to see you! Check out somewhere like Fortree! Staying in their tree houses feels like camping! Oh, and maybe a tour with Winona, where she takes you to observe the wild bird Pokémon in the area!

I’ve got a little brother, too, so I know eeeee-zackly what you mean, friend! How about this? You know the Gym Leaders in Mossdeep, Liza and Tate? Fact is, those two are complete opposites when it comes to personality and tastes and whatnot! Tate is a calm kid and loves to eat sweets, while rambunctious Liza loves spicy food! That’s just how they are! But they each rely on the other’s strengths to the fullest in Double Battles!

First, let me explain what kind of move Water Pulse is. It attacks the target with a pulsing blast of water. It’s a surprisingly healthy move. Guest: How strong is the pulsing water? James Movesworth: Good. That’s a very good question... Actually, it’s so strong that it can confuse the target. Guest: It seems we can use it in everyday life, doesn’t it? James Movesworth: That’s right. For example... Some fathers come home feeling very tired, right? At times like that, use this move, and you can massage him to sleep. It works very well.

Remember these tips with “TACO.” I’m more of a pasta guy, though... OK! See you next week!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Narrator: On today’s special episode of “The Pokémon Whisperer,” the dedicated Pokémon Breeder Paul talks about how to raise Pokémon. These tips will help get any Pokémon on the road to success. Paul: Take good notes! First, gently let the Pokémon out of the Poké Ball! Then loudly tell it how much you enjoy its company! Shouting is best! That’s it! Just repeat this 30 times a day! They’ll grow with the power of love! ...Probably! OK. See you next week!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV I was just your average girl until I was struck by a Thunder Shock. It was love at first sight, baby! And my target, a Gym Leader! I didn’t have any Pokémon then, but not a problem for a resourceful gal! The answer was simple—and we all know simple is best! I just had to become a Trainer. That’s all it took for me! “The Diary of a Poké Romantic” will soon make its debut! The pilot episode: “Love at First Sight: The Rules of the Move Attract!” By the way, how did everyone get their first Pokémon anyway?\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV After some fits and starts, a childhood friend gave me my first Pokémon! ...It was a Kricketot. Except...I don’t like the legs of bugs. I bet he gave me this because I picked on him when he was little... But though the road has been long and hard, I’m finally at the starting line! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode two! “The Maiden in Love and the Kricketot: The Magic of Romance Never Ends!” Oh, this Kricketot is a female. Maybe we can be friends.\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV I checked out my Kricketot and learned about its moves. ...It only knows Growl and Bide. That’s worse than just challenging! I was about to say that, when my childhood friend stopped me. “Let it hold an Oran Berry so that it can survive while using Bide.” Hey, that’s smart! That’s from a former Bug Catcher! While we’re at it, may I have an Oran Berry, too? Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode three! “Love Conquers All: Covering Weakness with Ideas!” We’re a Trainer and Pokémon now! We’ll get stronger together!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV I had my first ever Pokémon battle, and it ended badly... My childhood friend, a former Bug Catcher, had this to say... “Pokémon get tougher by battling. The key to victory is type matchups.” Type matchups? Types affect battles? The only type matchup I care about is with that Gym Leader! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode four! “Type Matchups Settle Battles! Moves That Exploit Weak Points!” Fire, Flying, and Rock... Kricketot has some disadvantages!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV We’d win a battle, and lose one. Lose one, then win one. Though it was at times discouraging, I had to keep battling to toughen us up. With me and Kricketot, it was always three steps forward, two steps back. But we were getting stronger. Then, one day, Kricketot started to shine! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode five! “Kricketot Becomes Kricketune! Watch Me! I’ll Change, Too!” And to cancel Evolution, press the B Button... Tell me that first!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV After Kricketot evolved, it became stronger as Kricketune. We also got other Pokémon, so we could go farther and farther from home. But where is my beloved Gym Leader? Where is that city he said he’s from? I do have the Town Map, but maps baffle me. It doesn’t matter, though. If we keep moving, we’ll get somewhere. Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode six! “How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms Can’t Be Found Everywhere!” The more lost you are, the less useful a map becomes! You know it’s true!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV Our journey was long, and it was hard. But no one wants to hear that! So, I finally found my Gym Leader. But he has an incurable disease! He begged me, out of the blue, with his last wish. He asked for my Pokémon! But my Kricketune’s my partner! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode seven! “My Trail of Footprints Shortened the Distance Between Us!” Every time I see Kricketune’s face, I am reminded of our time together...\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV My beloved Gym Leader, whom I fought so hard to meet, was a fraud! How dare he con this pure maiden! How dare he toy with my emotions! But whose fault was it? Was it mine for being taken in? All I know is that my tears overflow, and despair is my world... Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode eight! “Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!” That Gym Leader’s eating a Giga Impact for playing me for a fool!\n...</NPC>
<NPC id="0" name="TV" identifier="TV" language="9">Best of Sinnoh TV Having defeated the fake Gym Leader, Kricketune and I stood in a daze. We were spent. Drained by a romance that ended in a nightmare. It was then that my childhood friend, the former Bug Catcher, arrived. He did more than that. He confessed his love to me! “I wanted to become an Elite Four member, so I quit as a Gym Leader. But then that faker appeared. You took care of him, though!” Wait, ex-Bug Catcher! What? What are you saying?! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” final episode! “Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over Sinnoh Skies!” You were laughing at me for falling for that fraud, weren’t you?\n...</NPC>
