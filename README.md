Pokémon Unity is a framework dedicated to providing a framework built in the Unity3D engine for creating RPG-esque games. It's being developed privately currently. We welcome any and all improvements or pull requests. If you'd like to take a look at the source, you can clone the `beta` branch and take a look at that. This project is under active development, so everything will change. If you want to submit a pull request with any improvements, feel free. I make no guarantees about the usability of anything in this project.

## Demo and Downloads

There are examples for Windows, Linux, and Mac zipped in [Releases](https://github.com/PokemonUnity/PokemonUnity/releases)! These are very old and need to be updated, however. They show the state at which the engine was originally abandoned, and we've been hard at work since.
